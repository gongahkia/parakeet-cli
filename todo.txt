(B) In `parquet-lens-core/src/timeseries.rs`, handle the case where the timestamp column contains all-null values gracefully (currently may produce NaN min/max) — return a `TimeSeriesProfile` with `has_data: false` sentinel instead +stability
(B) Add a `'?'` overlay in TUI that shows a scrollable keybind reference table with all current keybinds (not just a static text block) using ratatui `Table` widget with `scroll_offset` state in `App` +dx
(B) Add `'I'` keybind in TUI sidebar to toggle showing only columns with null rate above a threshold (e.g., >5%) as a quick null-hot-spot filter +feature +dx
(B) Expose `PartitionInfo` from `stats_ext.rs` in a `View::Partitions` TUI view accessible via `'Q'` keybind, showing partition columns, values, and file counts +feature
(B) In `parquet-lens-core/src/sample.rs`, add `seed: Option<u64>` to `SampleConfig` for reproducible sampling (use seed to select deterministic row group indices instead of always taking the first N) +feature +stability
(B) In `parquet-lens-tui/src/main.rs`, after `Config::load()` fails, print a warning to stderr (`eprintln!`) with the config file path so users know why defaults are being used — currently `unwrap_or_default()` silently swallows the error +dx +stability
(B) Add a `'K'` keybind in TUI to copy the currently selected column's name to the system clipboard using `cli-clipboard` crate (add as optional dep) or fall back to printing to status bar +dx
(B) Add `--json` flag to `summary` subcommand in `parquet-lens-tui/src/main.rs` that outputs the `DatasetQuality` struct as raw JSON to stdout for pipeline use +feature +dx
